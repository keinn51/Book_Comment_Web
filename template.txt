Add regexpression for checking detail category

~delete this when commit! just enter dd!~
Current Version : v1.1

- what I did
Original category name looks like "book>social".
So I use regexpression to catch "social" in that string.
/(.+?)>(.+)/ is the expression. I can use the expression by 
str.match(regexp).

- What It is?
Officially /(.+?)>(.+)/ Explain in the order I think.

1. // : contains any expression you want.
2. /.>./ : Since the corresponding character is in the form of "character > character", 
  expression . stands for any character.
3. /.+>.+/ : + means more than one character.
4. /(.+)>(.+)/ : Grouping is done using parentheses. This returns the first and second groups as elements of the array.

"book>social", "book>social", "book", "social"] uses the returned format.
