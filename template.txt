Refactor the "db.js" and MyBooks component

~delete this when commit! just enter dd!~
Current Version : v1.1

Just edit the "db.js" make serve to me json data rather than just 
gives me "ispn" number. Because the ispn data makes me call axios 
manu times at one component. So until I can use real db, use the db.js 
json data.
