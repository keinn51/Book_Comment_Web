Add dev-server

Current Version : v1.0

Add dev-server, port num 3080. This is because, when developing through a live 
server using localhost, i cannot check the results of my code in real time.

- issue

you have to check the error "$RefreshReg$ is not defined". 
It occurs when i type "npm run dev".
