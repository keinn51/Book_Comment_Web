Use CSS grid to make MyInfo Box in MainPage

Current Version : v1.2

- What I Use
I used grid and applied it to the div corresponding to "InfoLetters" in "MainPage".

- The reason for using
If flexbox chooses alignment method in one axis direction (x or y), 
grid can choose div alignment in both axes. 
Therefore, it was adopted because it allows free placement of divs on the plane.

- Detail explaining
If there is a parent relationship in "div1 > div2"  way, if display=”grid” is 
applied to div1, the arrangement of div2 is changed to the grid setting. 
You can set grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows in the CSS of div1, 
which sets the size of each div in the row direction and the size of each div 
in the column direction.
