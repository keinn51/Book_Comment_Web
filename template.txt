Refactor folder structure adding "router", "render"

~delete this when commit! just enter dd!~
Current Version : v1.1

I just delete "pages", "lauouts" folders and use "router", "render".
Because all the jsx files in "pages" is more proper to be called 
"router" files than "pages". They are routes files in router.
All the files in "render" folder will be rendered at actual client 
page, so I think it is better to call them "render" files.
