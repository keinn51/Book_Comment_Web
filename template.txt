Use atom for using global state in "Favorite.js"

~delete this when commit! just enter dd!~
Current Version : v1.1

We use atom to share the current state value of "Favorites" between components.
Atom is a tool that allows the state value to be used globally among the 
components that use it. Among the components, a component called 
“CategoriesRecommend” and a component called “MyBooks” Use content 
from "Favorite.js".

However, if one component changes the value of Favorites, the other 
component can't figure it out. Let's assume that MyBooks modifies 
the value of "favorite.js". At this time, Favorite.js is just a js file, 
and this modification value is valid only in MyBooks scope. 
 "CategoriesRecommend" won't know the modified content at this reason.

So I felt the need to use atoms to manage state globally,
I use atom to solve this problem.
