FIX #1 - add refresh plugin

Current Version : v1.0

The term 'Hot Reloading' used in the general sense to refer to changing the content 
on the page but without a full page reload. Previously Hot Reloading for React was done 
with a technique called Hot Module Replacement, for technical reasons that approach is no 
longer used and instead React provides an API for "Fast Refresh." Fast Refresh is 
what we'll be using.

so i use the "@pmmmwh/react-refresh-webpack-plugin" to use react refresh in my 
project. I can use this plugin using with "babel-loader". So i can use "Fast Refresh",
by using this package.
