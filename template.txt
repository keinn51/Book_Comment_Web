Use transition to make slide for myBooks

Current Version : v1.2

- What I Use
By implementing a slide, the contents of MyBooks Component of MainPage 
can be viewed through the slide.

- The reason for using
Because I can list the books I have read, and you can easily see 
which books I have read with the click of a button. 
It can also give users the impression of a dynamic page motion.

- Detail explaining
Two components are used to implement the slide. 
A component called MybooksSlider allows the slider to be displayed 
and moves it when the "button" is pressed.

MyBooks is a component that renders while reading the book data 
stored in Favorites.js.

There are two main divs in "MybooksSlider", "SlidesViewer" and "Slides". 
"Slides" are a series of books that I want to show, and "SlidesViewer" 
can be thought of as a “frame” to restrict number of books. 

Only the books in the "SlidesViewer" are rendered and the rest of the books 
are invisible because "overflow:hidden" is handled. 
If you want to render only two books, you can set the width 
of the "SlidesViewer" by two width of books.

- Main Concept

(1) transform in CSS

The CSS transform property allows you to apply rotation, scaling, skew, 
and translation effects to elements. transform changes the coordinate 
space of the CSS visual formatting model.

translate can change the position of the element, 
and scale can change the size of the element. 
In this commit, I implemented the transition of the Slide sideways with 
translate, which increases the scale slightly when I put my hand on the Button.

opacity in CSS

You can set the opacity of an element with opacity. 
Default is 1, no inheritance. I used it to make the color lighter.

transition in CSS

With this option, the transform proceeds with a delay of about 0.5 seconds. 
I used it to show the slide dynamically.
