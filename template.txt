Add jsconfig.json to use Import Suggestion

Current Version : v1.1

fix #3, Pop-up for import proposal.

- Analysis
Javascript doesn't have type so when I develop the code, VScode compiler doesn't
check the files (components, modules...).

- Solution
Make jsconfig.json file and add "checkJS" option to check the files while i
develop the project code. Plus, add many options for jsconfig.json file to
use some convenient tools for me. 

"module, lib, target" option for setting up the files. 
optiton "module" can set the version of module exporting, so I can use 
"import" module when I made ".js" file. optiton "target" set the version
of bundle file (App). option "lib" is used for providing the list of 
library for compile to compiler.

Optuin "path" is also useful for developing code. It uses option "baseUrl" and
I can set alias for specific folder. I can use the root about that file, using 
alias not real root. So I have no need to use "../../../../" for writing the root.
