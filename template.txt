Update MyBooks using emotion props

~delete this when commit! just enter dd!~
Current Version : v1.2

- What I make
In "MyBooks", I passed props to emotion using the length of my book list 
existing in "Favorite.js", and updated CSS.

- The reason to do this
"Favorite.js" is temporary, but since it is a DB that lists my favorite books, 
I had to respond flexibly to the increasing length of this object. 
The best way is to send props to CSS to prepare for diverse situations.
